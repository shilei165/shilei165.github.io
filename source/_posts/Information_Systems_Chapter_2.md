# Why All Business Professionals Need to Be Information Systems Managers

+ IS are increasingly ingrained in our business and professional lives.
+ Everyone will use information system regardless of your major or your career.
+ Learning how to effectively use IS can help you be more effective and successful in your career.

# Overview of Systems

A **System** is a set of interacting components working together to form a complex, integrated whole to achieve some goal by taking inputs and processing them to produce outputs.
+ A system is made up of different pieces, called components. It can take many different forms, ranging from human organs to computer softwares.
+ These components work together; they are interrelated.
+ A system has some purpose or goals.
+ The goal is achieved by taking inputs and processing them to produce outputs.

A few systems-related concepts that are not apparent from the definition.
+ A system is separated from its environment by the system's boundary.
+ Most systems are **open system** -- interact with their environments.
+ Systems are often made up of **subsystems** -- a part of larger system.
+ **Equifinality** -- there are many different potential paths to the final outcome.
+ **Feedback and control** - a set of functions intended to ensure the proper operation of a system.

# Foundations of Information Systems
+ An information system does not require a computer. However, in this class, we are primarily concerned with computerized information system.
+ Information systems include the following operations (also called information processing cycle)
	1. *Input* -- Collection of data and their conversion into a form that allows processing.
	2. *Processing* -- Manipulation and transformation of data.
	3. *Storage* -- Holding place for data so that they can be retrieved at a larger time.
	4. *Output* -- Transformation of processed data into a form that can be understood.
	5. *Control* -- Enforcement of correct processing procedures.
+ Information systems have six critical elements.
	1. *Data* -- Raw facts, text, numbers, images...
	2. *Hardware* -- Physical devices (computers/hard disks, printers keyboards, etc.)
	3. *Software* -- Set of instructions that gorven the operation of IS (system software & application software)
	4. *Communication media* -- Set of devices and protocols (rules) that enable computers to communicate with each other (network cabling, routers, etc.)
	5. *People* -- Individuals who use the IS (most important component -- use/interpret/monitor/build/maintain)

# How Information Systems Help Us Deal with Information
+ First, information systems let us gather large amounts of data quickly, easily, and reliably.
	* Examples include the check out system in a grocery store.
+ Second, information systems allow businesses to store and organize very large amounts of data.
	* IS allow businesses to store volumes of data is an organized manner that allows for rapid retrieval.
+ Third, information systems perform their data manipulations quicky, accurately, and consistently.
	* As long as the hardware is operating correctly and the software is designed and implemented correctly, an information system is very consistent in its manipulations.
+ Finally, information systems let us retrieve and output information in a variety of forms, depending on what is useful to the user.
	* The same information can be displayed on a screen, printed, or graphed.

One important function of many business information systems is to enforce **business rules**.

+ A business rule is a statement that defines or constrains an aspect of a business with the intent of controlling behaviors within the business.
+ All businesses have rules that govern their operations. (Hotel reservation/ course registration)
+ Information systems enforce business rules by not allowing violations to occur.

# How Information Systems Facilitate Organizational Change

+ **Process Improvements**

	* IS can help organizations improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of processes.
	* Example: customer self-service/ ATM.

+ **Automation**

	* Some processes have been totally automated.
	* Example: online ordering.

+ **Control**

	* When properly designed and implemented, an information system can ensure that business rules are followed throughout a process.
	* Example: check credit card before accepting payment.

+ **Information Flow**

	* Workflow systems facilitate information flow throughout a work task.
	* Example: grade change --> auto email notification.

# Common Information Systems

**Classify information systems according to the impact or "reach" of the system**:

+ **Personal applications**
	- Help make individuals' daily work more efficient and effective
	- Example: Microsoft Office, Evernote or Onenote

+ **Transaction processing systems (TPSs)**
	- Collect, monitor, process, report, and store large volumes of data that are created by business processes.
	- Example: grocery store point-of-sale system

+ **Functional and management information systems**
	- Monitor, control, and analyze the operation of functional areas
	- Example: financial management systems, sales force automation systems

+ **Integrated enterprise systems**
	- Multiple applications in cohesive, interrelated system
	- Example: enterprise resource planning systems provide an integrated set of modules that carry out the information processing and reporting systems for the entire organization

+ **Interorganizational systems**
	- Span organizational boundaries to connect companies to suppliers and customers.
	- Electronic data interchange (EDI) is at the heart of many of these systems. It allows the systems interact with partner organization.

+ **Global systems**
	- Interorganizational systems that cross national boundaries
	- More complex than other systems
