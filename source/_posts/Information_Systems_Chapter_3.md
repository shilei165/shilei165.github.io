# Being a Smart Information Consumer
+ Online available information has both advantages and disadvantages
	* Advantages: easy access to information
	* Disadvantages: no quality control.
+ **Information evaluation** is the systematic determination of the merit and worth of information. Information evaluation skills will be important to you both personally and in your business career.
	* **Personally**: sift through and evaluate many kinds of information.
	* **Business Career**: your reputation & career success depends on the outcomes of the decisions you make, which based on better information.

# Information Overload and the Need to Evaluate Information
+ **Information overload** is being faced with more information than one can effectively process.
+ Information overload reduces productivity, increases stress, and can acutally lead to physical health problems.
+ Two major strategies for dealing with information overload are **filtering and withdrawal**.
	* **Withdrawal** involes disconnecting from sources of information. Example: not checking email, no TV, no Internet, etc.
	* **Filtering** involves knowing what information we need and what information merits attention and use. Example: choose which message to open and which to delete or ignore.

# Information Quality
**Information Quality** The degree to which information is suitable for a particular purpose. In other words, the information with high quality is useful toward the achievement of whatever task is at hand.

Wang and Strong put quality dimensions into four categories:
1. Intrinsic quality  --  important regardless of the context or how it is repsrsented.
2. Contextual quality  --  viewed differently depending on the task at hand.
3. Representational quality  --  concerns how the information is provided to the user.
4. Accessibility quality  --  whether authorized users can easily access the information.

A few points regarding the classification of quality dimension
1. There is considerable disagreement regarding the dimensions of information quality.
2. It is important to consider the context when thinking about the information quality.
3. Information quality has a cost. **Sufficient quality** is usually we want.
	* For more important, higher impact decisions, it is worthwhile to pay much more attention to information quality than for lower consequence decision. Example: buying a house vs. notebook paper.

# Evaluating Information
There are two questions you need to answer:
+ (1) Is the information useful?
+ (2) Is the information believable?

## Evaluating Usefulness
+ **Relevant**
	* Will this information help me accomplish my task?
+ **Appropriate**
	* Is the information suitable for your purpose?
+ **Current**
	* How current you need the information to be?
+ Consistent
+ Understandable

## Evaluating Believability
+ **Credible**
	* Author's or the information source's reputation, influence, and experience
+ **Objective**
	* Whether the source of the information is relevent to or has interest conflict with the reported product or service
	* Whether it use the persuasive or emotional lanuage
+ **Supported**
	* Claims without support should not be trusted
	* When support is offered, you should evaluate the quality of the support
	* Consider the reasonableness of the claim
	* Think about whether the claim is testable
+ **Comprehensive**
	* Assessing comprehensiveness requires assessing the **depth and breadth** of the informaiton
	* Breadth concern whether all aspects of a topic are covered
	* Depth concerns the level of detail provided

**The more information you evaluate, the more some of this will become second nature.**
